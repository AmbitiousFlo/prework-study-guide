        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visable content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>An HTML attribute defines additional information about an element.</li>
          <li>HTML attributes are always defined in the beginning element, never the closing element.</li>
          <li>An element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag.</li>
          <li>Tag refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets.</li>
          <li>H1-H6 are elements represent the level of heading a given text block represents.</li>
          <li>The p element represents a paragraph or block of text.</li>
          <li>The ul, ol, and li elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items.</li>
          <li>The img element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage.</li>
          <li>The src attribute is the most important because it defines the location of the image</li>
          <li>The br element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content.</li>
          <li>The a element (which stands for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or other webpages.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Cascading Style Sheets CSS is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users.</li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>Use Inline CSS when you want to style an element directly in the HTML file.</li>
          <li>Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, Useful for quick permanent changes</li>
          <li>Style attribute changes colors on a webpage.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
          <li>Link element creates the connection to the external file.</li>
          <li>The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource.</li>
          <li>The href attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource.</li>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="git-section">
        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch  we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>(git pull origin main) pulls the remote branch into the local main branch. When this is done your branches should be in sync.</li>
          <li>Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of each version of your project.</li>
          <li>GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that allows us to keep track of our projects inside repositories that are stored remotely.</li>
          <li>Markdown is a lightweight plain-text formatting language. Working in a Markdown file is similar to working with a .doc, except we have to use special syntax for formatting.</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <li>JavaScript is a powerful programming language that can add interactivity to a website. It was invented by Brendan Eich.</li>
        <li>Variable is simply a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
        <li>In JavaScript, to declare a variable, we use the (var) keyword.</li>
        <li>Note that each line of JavaScript code ends with a semicolon.</li>
        <li>Note that a string is contained within quotation marks.</li>
        <li>You can access a whole string by refering to the variables name.</li>
        <li>We can use the (console.log) method to output a message to the web console by adding an argument.</li>
        <li>The word (console) refers to a test environment that developers use to check out their code.</li>
        <li>.log(), is a method, which means a set of instructions that can be executed by a computer.</li>
        <li>Note that whereas the style.css file is linked within the (head) element, the script.js file is linked within the (body) element.</li>
        <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
        <li>Conditional statements and loops can control the order in which code is executed, or if it is even executed at all.</li>
        <li>The strict equality operator (===) checks to see if two values are equal, and returns a Boolean result true if the values are equal and false if the values are not equal.</li>
        <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data.</li>
        <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
        <li>Commenting out code makes it inactive without deleting it, just in case you need it later.</li>
        <li>A function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
