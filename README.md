# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

- My motivation for building this project was to give myself the confidence, So when I need  to refresh my memory on any one of these subjects I would be able to do that using this study guide.
- I built this project because I have a true passion to learn and be the best developer I can be, and this project will help me reach my goals.
- The main problem this study guide solves for me is I now have all my important information about HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript all in one place and this makes it easier to study and recall information.
- I learned many things during this prework but I feel like the most important thing I learned is to make sure you are precise and have a solid foundation in your code, I also learned that debugging is really important along with testing your webpage before it goes live.
